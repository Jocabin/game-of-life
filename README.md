# Game of life

## Build
Just run the `./build.sh` file, or build the project with the Odin compiler.

**WARNING: You will need the Odin compiler to run the project. I don't want to ship binaries.**

## Keybindings
- SPACEBAR: Play/pause the simulation
- S: Step by step the simulation
- C: Clear the board
- LEFT CLICK: Draw a cell
- RIGHT CLICK: Erase a cell

You can draw cells only when simulation is paused. It's a choice, not a constraint.
